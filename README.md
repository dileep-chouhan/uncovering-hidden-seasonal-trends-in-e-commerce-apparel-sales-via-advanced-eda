# Uncovering Hidden Seasonal Trends in E-commerce Apparel Sales via Advanced EDA

**Overview:**

This project performs an Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) on e-commerce apparel sales data to uncover hidden seasonal sales patterns within specific subcategories.  The analysis aims to identify previously unknown trends that can inform inventory management strategies and the development of more effective targeted marketing campaigns.  The EDA involves data cleaning, visualization, and statistical analysis to reveal insights into seasonal fluctuations and their impact on sales performance.

**Technologies Used:**

* Python
* Pandas
* Matplotlib
* Seaborn
* NumPy (implicitly used by other libraries)

**How to Run:**

1. **Clone the repository:**  Clone this repository to your local machine using `git clone <repository_url>`.
2. **Install dependencies:** Navigate to the project directory and install the required Python libraries using:  `pip install -r requirements.txt`
3. **Run the analysis:** Execute the main script using: `python main.py`

**Example Output:**

The script will print key findings and statistical summaries to the console, providing insights into seasonal sales trends across different apparel subcategories.  Additionally, the analysis will generate several visualization files (e.g., `sales_trend.png`, potentially others depending on the analysis performed), showcasing identified seasonal patterns graphically. These plots will be saved in the project's directory.  The specific plots generated will depend on the data and the analysis performed, but will generally include charts illustrating sales over time, broken down by category and season.
